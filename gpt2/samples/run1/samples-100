ias, no matter how much one does.

I think there's so much fun to be had right now in terms of talking to her and getting to know her. And in regards to how much that relationship has changed, I am extremely optimistic and optimistic. There are some positive feelings about talking to her, the feeling that this is a more authentic and kind of her moment, and that when things are going badly, she has to be at her best when it goes wrong, whether that be when things get really bad or when things, in your opinion, are going all right. It's a very, very, very positive thing to have, and it's an extremely, very good thing to have, so I think for me, as a woman in general, has an amazing experience.

I know that there's a lot of emotion that's thrown some folks up. And so, you know, as I mentioned, I think there are so many conversations going on that affect us as a person. And I think, as a lady, I think I'm pretty much in a position of saying, I am not as good at talking to girls as you are, and so I want, as much as I do, to be the best woman I can be. So I think that I do as much as I can to make as many opportunities available to me, as much as I can, as much as I can, to be kind of part of as much as we as men can be.

And so, as to how much I am really, really, really grateful for how I have spent the last year, has spent so much time in this office, that has been so stressful for me when I would be in my early 20s, 20-something years.

And as to how much she's thankful for the support here, I mean, really thankful for her, just, as much as we as we as as as men, if you couldn't, if you couldn't help, if you, as men, you would, as a woman, as a young woman, as a woman, as a young woman, as a woman, as a young woman, as a woman, as a woman. I mean, you know, I know she has been and I know she has spent so much time living and having this wonderful time, and she has seen so much. So, we, you know, we love her. We, you know, we're so appreciative here.
